A simple yet functional dwelling was built, and attracted some poor new denizens
who apparently had even worse living conditions before. Mining expeditions
hauled respectable amounts of common metals to the surface. The east was mapped,
the Pyramid was disappointingly empty, and the ocean sharks were fed with
imbecile adventurers. Construction of a hellevator and a skybridge was intiated,
and plans were made on the murder of the Eye of Chthulhu.

Dain and acc joined the party! Our heroes mined a meteorite and killed the Brain
of Chthulhu no less than three times. They explored the skies, bathed in some
lava, and finally went to hell and bathed in more lava.

Our heroes Mellancore, acc and emlun warmed up by swiftly dispatching the Eye of
Chthulhu no less than three times, and then proceeded exploring the west.
Mellancore and emlun explored and looted the dungeon while acc was hard at work
decorating the same with gravestones. Our heroes then went to harvest Ivy Whips
and Blades of Grass from the jungle, and accidentally killed the Queen Bee on
the way. Back in the base a clothier, a mechanic and a goblin moved in and a
modest beginning of a greenhouse was built. At the end of the day our heroes
were all equipped with magic mirrors, rocket boots and obsidian shields, looking
forward to going back to hell at the next opportunity.
