A simple yet functional dwelling was built, and attracted some poor new denizens
who apparently had even worse living conditions before. Mining expeditions
hauled respectable amounts of common metals to the surface. The east was mapped,
the Pyramid was disappointingly empty, and the ocean sharks were fed with
imbecile adventurers. Construction of a hellevator and a skybridge was intiated,

Dain and acc joined the party! Our heroes mined a meteorite and killed the Brain
of Chthulhu no less than three times. They explored the skies, bathed in some
lava, and finally went to hell and bathed in more lava.
